# TicTacToe5x5_withAi
GUI based 5x5 tic tac toe game with 2 modes 1.player vs AI  2.player vs player

I have also added time delay wherein if the player does not submit his move within 5 seconds he/she loses the game.

I built this code after referring to an article from geek for geeks. It was a 3x3 board, i just changed it to 5x5 board adding the win conditions and also gave time delay as an add on.
